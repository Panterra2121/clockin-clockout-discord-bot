# Problems (i didn't fix) :
- The buttons wont work if u restart the bot (you will have to delete the message and send it again)
- Some translations weren't made. (some are still in romanian for 2-3 commands)

# I posted it here because i got bored after some time working on it. it already is a clock-in clock-out bot out there but you can start from this too, if you want to customize your embed and stuff. It definately is a great thing to start from if you want use it or make your own. It was made in my personal preferences so yeah. Have a good day ! (I'm sorry if i missed any problems out there)
